# Blog-Website
A simple blog website built using Node.js, Express.js, EJS, MongoDB, Mongoose, and bootstrap. 

Acknowledgment: I followed Angela Yu's Blog Website tutorial for guidance regarding a good portion of the code. 

I added features that include: a compose button on the home page, an option to add author name when creating a blog post, and functionality to display the timestamp with every post, which is the time and date when that blog post was created.

You can see the site working at:
https://desolate-headland-05133.herokuapp.com/
which was setup using mongoDB Atlas, and Heroku.
