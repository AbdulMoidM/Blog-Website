# Blog-Website
This is a simple blog website built using Node.js, Express.js, EJS, and some bootstrap. 
Acknowledgement: I followed Angela Yu's Blog Website tutorial a good portion of the code. I added some features that include:
a compose button on the home page, an option to add author name when creating a blog post, and functionality to display the 
timestamp witt every post, which is the time and date when that blog post was created.
